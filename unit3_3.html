        <div>
      <p>A Digital portfolio it is simply a CV and a cover letter in a single digital solution that allows employers to verify
      what kind of experience you have gained during your studies. You can also enter previous jobs, your personal experiences
      and what kind of skills you have and what your goals are.</p>
      <p>Another purpose for making this portfolio is to show off my talents, also to apply for job apprendiship. I have also
      made this page to show my friends and family what I complete at school and at home.
      The traditional portfolio represents the first and essential tool for a recruiter to be able to know and select a
      candidate. It will therefore always have its relevance; however it is no longer the only tool.</p> <p>Today the recruiters,
      paper CV in hand, also consult the profiles on Social networks to find details and characteristics of the candidate.
      However, that not only the way in which companies evaluate the characteristics of candidates has changed, but also the
      characteristics they seek in them.</p>
      <p>These sought-after characteristics can not only be evaluated by the classic CV, which is nothing more than a list of
      experiences, study or professional, but are purely creative, character and aesthetic characteristics. It is much easier
      to evaluate these characteristics through what we have published on social media, from our photos, descriptions and
      anything else that may be visible from our profiles.</p>

       <summary><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i>Purpose of Portfolio?</summary>
       <div>
        <p>In my digital Portfolio, I talk about myself, where I come from, some personal information that are required to access
        the world of work, all the work experiences I have gained in life, what professions I have done in my life and what are
        the things where I have a strength and weakness.
        My Portfolio included all the subjects I am studying at school and which are the ones where I am most successful in
        practice, that is to say what my profession will be, Web designer, networking, and so on.
        I would say web designer and web developer it is my choice right now.

        <summary><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i>Target audience of Portfolio?</summary>
        <div>
          <p>Having a digital portfolio nowadays is essential especially in this field. Another great possibility that digital
          portfolio gives me is to insert it in my CV so try to apply for an apprenticeship in the area where I live.
          </p>
          <p>In fact, I was thinking of applying to a company that is looking for translators of my native language who have
          e-commerce sites in English but sell Italian and Spanish products and need people trained as translators. Yet another
          possibility 'can be a service desk in helping people with problems in their computer remotely.</p>

        <summary><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i>Consideration in making  Portfolio?</summary>
        <div>
          <p>How do people who cannot move their arms use your website? What about people who do not see well or do not see at all?
          Alternatively, people who have hearing or understanding difficulties or have other disabilities? Alternatively, people
          who do not speak English or have difficulty expressing themselves?
          </p>
          <p>There are resources that are not featured here in this portfolio of mine on how to overcome these social barriers and
          help developers, designers and others understand the principles for building websites, web applications, browsers and
          other accessible web tools.</p>
